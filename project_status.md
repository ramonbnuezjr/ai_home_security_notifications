## Current Sprint Focus
**Sprint 2:** Web Dashboard & System Integration
- Implement web dashboard (Epic 5)
- Create live video streaming interface
- Build event history and configuration UI
- Integrate all services into unified system

## Performance Notes
- **Motion Detection**: 30 FPS (excellent)
- **YOLO on CPU**: 1-2 FPS (expected, ARM CPU limitation)
- **Combined System**: 1-2 FPS (YOLO is bottleneck)
- **Recommended Upgrade**: AI HAT+ (Hailo-8L) for 20-30 FPS with YOLO

## Open Issues
- Web dashboard implementation pending
- Event history database schema needed
- System monitoring metrics collection
- User authentication system needed
- Hardware acceleration for YOLO (AI HAT+ recommended)

## Blockers
- None - all core functionality operational
- Performance acceptable for current use case
- AI HAT+ upgrade optional (system works without it)

## Risk Status
- **Low Risk:** Web dashboard complexity (well-defined requirements)
- **Low Risk:** Database integration (using SQLite)
- **Low Risk:** Frontend development (using Flask + simple HTML/JS)

## Next Actions
1. Begin Epic 5: Web Dashboard implementation
2. Create event database schema
3. Implement live video streaming endpoint
4. Build system configuration interface
5. Add user authentication (Epic 6)

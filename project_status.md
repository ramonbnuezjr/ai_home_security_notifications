- [x] Risk management framework
- [x] Development workflow
- [x] Deployment guide

## Testing Milestones
- [ ] Unit testing framework
- [ ] Integration testing setup
- [ ] Hardware-in-loop testing
- [ ] Performance testing suite

## Current Sprint Focus
**Sprint 3:** Security & Privacy (Epic 6)
- Implement user authentication system
- Add data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Build privacy control interface
- Create audit logging system

## Performance Notes
- **Motion Detection**: 30 FPS (excellent)
- **YOLO on CPU**: 1-2 FPS (expected, ARM CPU limitation)
- **Combined System**: 1-2 FPS (YOLO is bottleneck)
- **Recommended Upgrade**: AI HAT+ (Hailo-8L) for 20-30 FPS with YOLO

## Open Issues
- User authentication system needed (Epic 6)
- Data encryption not yet implemented
- Privacy controls needed
- Hardware acceleration for YOLO (AI HAT+ recommended - optional)

## Blockers
- None - all core functionality operational
- Performance acceptable for current use case
- AI HAT+ upgrade optional (system works without it)

## Risk Status
- **Low Risk:** Web dashboard complexity (well-defined requirements)
- **Low Risk:** Database integration (using SQLite)
- **Low Risk:** Frontend development (using Flask + simple HTML/JS)

## Next Actions
1. Test web dashboard and database integration thoroughly
2. Begin Epic 6: Security & Privacy Controls
3. Implement user authentication with password hashing
4. Add session management and role-based access control
5. Implement data encryption for sensitive information
6. Create privacy controls and data retention policies

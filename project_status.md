## Current Sprint Focus
**Sprint 4:** System Integration & Production Readiness
- Integrate Epic 6 authentication into web dashboard (Epic 5)
- Add HTTPS/TLS support to Flask web interface
- Perform comprehensive security audit
- Create production deployment guide
- Set up automated backup procedures

## Performance Notes
- **Motion Detection**: 30 FPS (excellent)
- **YOLO on CPU**: 1-2 FPS (expected, ARM CPU limitation)
- **Combined System**: 1-2 FPS (YOLO is bottleneck)
- **Recommended Upgrade**: AI HAT+ (Hailo-8L) for 20-30 FPS with YOLO

## Open Issues
- Web dashboard needs authentication integration (Epic 6 services ready)
- TLS/HTTPS not yet configured for web interface
- Hardware acceleration for YOLO (AI HAT+ recommended - optional upgrade)

## Blockers
- None - all core functionality operational
- Performance acceptable for current use case
- AI HAT+ upgrade optional (system works without it)

## Risk Status
- **Low Risk:** Web dashboard complexity (well-defined requirements)
- **Low Risk:** Database integration (using SQLite)
- **Low Risk:** Frontend development (using Flask + simple HTML/JS)

## Next Actions
1. Integrate Epic 6 authentication into web dashboard
   - Add JWT middleware to protect API endpoints
   - Create login/logout UI components
   - Implement user management interface
   - Add role-based access control to dashboard features
2. Add HTTPS/TLS to Flask application
   - Generate production TLS certificates
   - Configure Flask/Nginx for HTTPS
   - Update all HTTP references to HTTPS
3. Perform comprehensive security audit
   - Review all API endpoints for security
   - Test authentication and authorization
   - Validate encryption implementation
   - Check for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
4. Create production deployment guide
   - Hardware setup instructions
   - Software installation steps
   - Security hardening checklist
   - Backup and recovery procedures
5. Optional: Hardware acceleration upgrade
   - Evaluate AI HAT+ (Hailo-8L) for YOLO acceleration
   - Test performance improvements (target: 20-30 FPS)

## 2025-10-12 (YOLOv8 Object Detection Integration - COMPLETE)
- **✅ YOLOv8 Successfully Integrated with Motion Detection**
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Created `ObjectDetectionService` with YOLOv8s model
  - Integrated into motion detection pipeline (only runs when motion detected)
  - Enhanced `MotionEvent` dataclass to include detected objects
  - Updated `live_motion_detection.py` with real-time object classification
  - Added interactive YOLO toggle (press 'O' key)
  - Added command-line confidence threshold override (--confidence flag)
  - Added frame skipping feature for smoother live view (--yolo-skip flag)
  - Added all-classes override flag (--all-classes)
- **Technical Specifications:**
  - Model: YOLOv8s (small variant, 21.5MB)
  - Classes: 80 object types (COCO dataset) - ALL ENABLED
  - Default confidence threshold: 0.5 (configurable via CLI)
  - Inference time: ~500-1000ms on Pi 5 (CPU-only, expected)
  - Live view performance: ~1-2 FPS during detection (normal for Pi 5 CPU)
- **Features Implemented:**
  - Real-time object detection with bounding boxes
  - Color-coded labels by class (green=person, blue=car, etc.)
  - Confidence scores displayed on each detection
  - Toggle YOLO on/off during runtime (press 'O')
  - Configurable class filtering (default: all 80 classes enabled)
  - Object size filtering (min/max)
  - Frame skipping for smoother performance (--yolo-skip N)
  - CLI confidence override (--confidence 0.25)
- **Files Created:**
  - `src/services/object_detection_service.py` (400+ lines)
  - `scripts/test_yolo.py` (YOLO installation test)
  - `scripts/test_object_detection.py` (headless object detection test)
  - `scripts/test_small_objects.py` (specialized test for small objects)
  - `YOLO_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` (comprehensive documentation)
  - `QUICKSTART.md` (quick reference guide)
  - `INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md` (completion summary)
- **Configuration Changes:**
  - Changed target_classes from ["person", "car", ...] to [] (all classes)
  - Changed ignore_classes from ["cat", "dog", "bird"] to [] (no filtering)
  - Documented filter rationale (security focus vs testing/development)
- **Dependencies Added:**
  - ultralytics 8.3.212
  - torch 2.8.0
  - torchvision 0.23.0
  - numpy 1.26.4 (downgraded for picamera2 compatibility)
- **Testing Results:**
  - ✓ YOLO model downloads and initializes successfully
  - ✓ Warmup inference completes (~3-4 seconds, one-time)
  - ✓ 80 object classes available
  - ✓ Integration with motion detection verified
  - ✓ Successfully detected: person, cell phone, cup, remote control
  - ✓ Class filtering issue identified and resolved
  - ✓ Performance characteristics documented and understood
- **Performance:**
  - Motion detection: ~30 FPS (unchanged, no slowdown)
  - Object detection: Only runs when motion detected (efficient design)
  - First inference: ~3-4s (warmup), subsequent: ~500-1000ms
  - Live view with YOLO: ~1-2 FPS during detection (expected for CPU inference)
  - Frame skipping mode: ~15-20 FPS (smoother, use --yolo-skip 2)
- **Issues Resolved:**
  - numpy version conflict (2.x incompatible with picamera2) → downgraded to 1.26.4
  - Class filtering hiding detections → disabled filters, documented rationale
  - Performance expectations → documented CPU limitations and trade-offs
- **Documentation:**
  - Created comprehensive integration guide (YOLO_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)
  - Created quick start guide (QUICKSTART.md)
  - Created completion summary (INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md)
  - Updated all documentation with current configuration
  - Includes testing instructions, troubleshooting, and configuration
  - Example usage and interactive controls documented
  - Performance expectations and optimization strategies documented
- **Epic 3:** Object detection integration complete, tested, and fully documented

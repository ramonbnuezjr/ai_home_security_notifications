# Database Integration Complete âœ…

## What Was Added

The live detection system now automatically logs all security events to the SQLite database, making them visible in the web dashboard's Event History page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `scripts/live_detection_with_notifications.py`

Added database integration:
- **DatabaseService initialization**: Connects to SQLite database on startup
- **Event logging**: Every object detection that triggers a notification is now saved
- **Object tracking**: All detected objects (person, car, etc.) are stored with confidence scores
- **Statistics**: Database stats shown at shutdown

### 2. What Gets Logged

When an object is detected and a notification is sent, the following is saved:

**Event Record:**
- Timestamp
- Event type: `object_detected`
- Severity: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical` (based on detected objects)
- Zone name: `Camera 1`
- Motion percentage
- Threat level
- Metadata (detected object labels, frame count)

**Detected Objects:**
- Class name (person, car, dog, etc.)
- Confidence score
- Bounding box coordinates
- Threat level

## How to Test

### Step 1: Run the Live Detection System

```bash
cd /home/ramon/ai_projects/ai_home_security_notifications
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/live_detection_with_notifications.py
```

### Step 2: Trigger Some Detections

- Wait for the background model to stabilize (2-3 seconds)
- Wave your hand or walk in front of the camera
- Wait for YOLO to detect objects (person, cell phone, etc.)
- A notification will be sent and **the event will be logged to the database**

You'll see output like:
```
ðŸ“§ Event 1 logged and notification sent: ['person'] detected!
   Priority: high
   Motion: 45.2%
```

### Step 3: View Events in Web Dashboard

1. Keep the detection script running (or stop it with 'Q')
2. In another terminal, start the web dashboard:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ramon/ai_projects/ai_home_security_notifications
   source venv/bin/activate
   python scripts/run_dashboard.py
   ```

3. Open your browser to: `http://192.168.7.210:5000` or `http://localhost:5000`

4. Navigate to **Event History** page

5. You should now see your detection events with:
   - Timestamp
   - Event type
   - Severity badge
   - Motion percentage
   - Detected objects

## Database Location

**Primary path** (requires permissions):
```
/mnt/ssd/security_data/database/security.db
```

**Fallback path** (currently in use):
```
/home/ramon/security_data/database/security.db
```

To use the SSD location:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/ssd/security_data/database
sudo chown -R ramon:ramon /mnt/ssd/security_data
```

## Event Cooldown

To prevent database spam, events are only logged when:
- Motion is detected
- YOLO detects objects
- Notifications are enabled
- **30 seconds have passed since the last notification**

You can adjust this cooldown in the script:
```python
notification_cooldown = 30  # seconds between notifications
```

## Statistics at Shutdown

When you stop the detection system (press 'Q'), you'll see:
```
Database:
  Total events: 5
  Total objects detected: 12
  Database size: 0.02 MB
```

## What's Next

Now that events are being logged:
- âœ… View event history in the web dashboard
- âœ… Filter events by date, type, severity
- âœ… See detected objects for each event
- âœ… Track system activity over time

The Event History page will automatically populate as new detections occur!

## Troubleshooting

### No events showing in dashboard?

1. **Make sure you triggered detections:**
   - Run `live_detection_with_notifications.py`
   - Wait for objects to be detected (you'll see "Event X logged..." message)

2. **Check database exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh /home/ramon/security_data/database/security.db
   ```

3. **Verify events were saved:**
   ```bash
   sqlite3 /home/ramon/security_data/database/security.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events;"
   ```

4. **Refresh the Event History page** in your browser

### Database locked error?

This can happen if both the detection script and dashboard are running. This is normal - SQLite with WAL mode handles concurrent access. Just wait a moment and try again.

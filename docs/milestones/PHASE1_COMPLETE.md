- ✅ Motion zone support (configurable in YAML)
- ✅ Performance: 30 FPS sustained

### Epic 3: AI Classification System

- ✅ 80 object classes from COCO dataset
- ✅ Smart optimization: Only runs when motion detected
- ✅ Real-time bounding boxes and labels
- ✅ Performance: 1-2 FPS on CPU (500-1000ms inference)

### Epic 4: Notification System
- ✅ **Voice Notifications** - espeak TTS (fully working!)

## 🎮 How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
cd /home/ramon/ai_projects/ai_home_security_notifications
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/live_detection_with_notifications.py
```

### Controls (in video window)
- **Q** - Quit
- **N** - Send test notification
- **S** - Toggle notifications ON/OFF
- **O** - Toggle YOLO ON/OFF
- **3/5/7/9** - Adjust motion sensitivity

### What You'll See/Hear
- Live camera feed with motion detection
- Green boxes around detected motion
- YOLO labels on detected objects
- **Voice announcements when objects detected!** 🤖

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Feature | Performance | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Camera Capture | 1920x1080 @ 19.5 FPS | ✅ Excellent |
| Motion Detection | ~30 FPS | ✅ Excellent |
| YOLO Detection (CPU) | 1-2 FPS | ⚠️ Functional (see note) |
| Voice Notifications | <1s latency | ✅ Excellent |
| System Stability | No crashes | ✅ Excellent |

**Note on YOLO Performance**: 1-2 FPS is expected on ARM CPU. This is normal behavior, not a bug. The system intelligently only runs YOLO when motion is detected. For 20-30 FPS, upgrade to AI HAT+ (Hailo-8L) - see `docs/HARDWARE_UPGRADES.md`.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi 5 (16GB RAM)
- Camera Module 3 (IMX708 sensor)
- 64GB+ microSD/SSD
- Audio output (HDMI or 3.5mm jack)

### Software
- **OS**: Raspberry Pi OS (Debian Bookworm)
- **Python**: 3.11+
- **Camera**: picamera2 (native Pi library)
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV 4.12.0
- **AI Model**: YOLOv8s (Ultralytics)
- **TTS**: espeak (text-to-speech)
- **Notifications**: Custom multi-channel framework

### Architecture
- Modular service-based design
- Thread-safe operations
- Async notification delivery
- Graceful degradation (services can fail independently)
- Configuration-driven (YAML)

## 🐛 Challenges Overcome

### Integration Issues
1. **Camera frame format** - Resolved tuple unpacking
2. **Attribute naming** - Fixed `class_name` vs `label` mismatch
3. **Missing attributes** - Added default threat levels
4. **Statistics keys** - Corrected key names across services

### Setup Issues
5. **TTS engine** - Installed espeak
6. **Audio output** - Clarified local vs remote (SSH) audio
7. **Email config** - Graceful fallback when unconfigured
8. **Performance expectations** - Documented realistic CPU performance

All challenges documented in `EPIC4_NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md`.

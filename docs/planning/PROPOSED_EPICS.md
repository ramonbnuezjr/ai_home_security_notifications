## üéØ Next Steps Recommendation

**Start with Epic 7 (USB Audio)** - Quick wins, builds on existing HAL voice

Then move to **Epic 10 (Case & NVMe)** - Improves base hardware before adding AI HAT

Then tackle **Epic 11 (AI HAT)** - Requires good cooling from new case

Face recognition (Epic 8) can happen in parallel - requires family participation for training data.

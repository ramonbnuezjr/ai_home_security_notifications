# Future Vision: Personal AI Assistant

## üß† Overview

Transform the home security system into a **personal AI assistant** that:
- Lives locally on your Pi 5 (privacy-first)
- Understands context through security cameras
- Helps with daily tasks and questions
- Evolves into a robotic assistant with mobility

---

## üéØ Vision: Personal AI Assistant Platform

### Core Concept
A fully local, privacy-focused AI that learns your routine, helps with tasks, and eventually gains physical presence through robotics.

---

## Phase 1: AI Brain (Current Foundation ‚úÖ)

### What We Have
- ‚úÖ Camera input (Pi Camera Module 3)
- ‚úÖ Object detection (YOLO)
- ‚úÖ Motion detection
- ‚úÖ Voice output (HAL 9000 Voice)
- ‚úÖ 16GB RAM (plenty for models)
- ‚úÖ Secure local storage

### What We're Adding
- üîÑ USB mic input (Epic 7)
- üîÑ Face recognition (Epic 8)
- üîÑ NVMe storage (Epic 10)
- üîÑ AI HAT for acceleration (Epic 11)

---

## Phase 2: Local LLM Integration üí¨

### Goal: Run Mistral 7B Quantized Locally

**Why Mistral 7B?**
- Fits in 16GB RAM (quantized to 4-bit)
- Fast inference on Pi 5 CPU
- Good for daily tasks and questions
- Privacy-preserving (never leaves your Pi)

### Implementation Strategy

#### Option A: Quantized Mistral (Recommended)
```python
# Easy to run with llama.cpp
from llama_cpp import Llama

llm = Llama(
    model_path="./mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf",
    n_ctx=4096,
    n_threads=4  # Use all 4 cores
)

# Ask questions about security events
response = llm(
    "The camera detected a person at the front door at 3:45pm. Who might that be?",
    max_tokens=256,
    temperature=0.7
)
```

**Performance Expectations:**
- Inference: 2-3 seconds per response
- Memory: ~6-8GB
- Useable quality for security context

#### Option B: Cloud Fallback
- Use local for quick questions (under 1 second response time threshold)
- Fall back to cloud (OpenAI, Anthropic) for complex reasoning
- Smart routing based on query complexity

#### Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)
```python
def ask_ai(question, context):
    # Simple queries ‚Üí local
    if is_simple_query(question):
        return local_llm(question)
    
    # Complex reasoning ‚Üí cloud
    elif needs_cloud(question):
        return cloud_llm(question, context)
    
    # Default: local with speed advantage
    else:
        return local_llm(question)
```

---

## Phase 3: Contextual Understanding üéØ

### Connect AI to Camera Input

**Use Case Examples:**

#### 1. Daily Routine Learning
```python
# AI observes and learns
"AI, what time does my wife usually get home?"
# ‚Üí AI checks camera logs, identifies person via face recognition
# ‚Üí "Your wife arrives between 5:15pm and 5:45pm on weekdays"

# When she arrives late:
Camera: "Person detected: wife (face match: 98%)"
AI: "Someone matching your wife's profile arrived at 6:30pm today"
```

#### 2. Smart Security Alerts
```python
# AI provides context
Camera: "Person detected at front door"
AI: "This person is not recognized. They've been standing at the door for 2 minutes. This is unusual compared to normal delivery patterns."
```

#### 3. Family Tracking (Privacy-Conscious)
```python
# AI answers questions about family
"AI, are the kids home from school yet?"
# ‚Üí Checks camera logs, face recognition
# ‚Üí "Your older son arrived at 2:45pm. Younger son and dog left with your wife at 1pm."
```

#### 4. Task Assistance
```python
# AI helps with reminders
"AI, remind me when I see my neighbor to ask about those concert tickets"
Camera: "Person detected: neighbor"
AI: "REMINDER: Ask neighbor about concert tickets"
```

---

## Phase 4: Voice Interaction üó£Ô∏è

### Transform to Interactive AI

#### What We Already Have
- ‚úÖ Voice output (HAL 9000 Voice)
- üîÑ USB mic input (Epic 7)
- üîÑ Face recognition (Epic 8)

#### Add:
- Wake word detection ("Hey HAL")
- Continuous conversation
- Voice command recognition
- Audio feedback for actions

#### Example Interaction
```python
You: "Hey HAL, who was at the door?"
HAL: "Motion detected at front door at 3:45pm. Face recognition: unk nown person. They stayed for approximately 30 seconds."
You: "Was there a delivery?"
HAL: "Yes. Packages visible in hand. Estimated 2 packages."
You: "Save this event"
HAL: "Event saved. Noted as delivery."
```
